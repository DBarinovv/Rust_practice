### Task: Parallel Matrix Multiplication

You are given two matrices `A` and `B`. Your task is to write a Rust program that multiplies these matrices using parallel computation. You should divide the matrices into chunks and perform the multiplication of these chunks in separate threads.

Here are the constraints and requirements:

- Matrices `A` and `B` are square matrices of size `n x n`.
- You should create a user-defined number of threads to perform the computation.
- Each thread should be responsible for computing a specific portion of the resulting matrix `C`.
- You must ensure that the computation is correct and that the threads access the matrices in a safe manner.
- You may use standard libraries like `std::thread` or third-party libraries like `rayon` to achieve parallelism.

Here's a high-level algorithm to help you get started:

1. Determine the size of chunks to be processed by each thread. This could be a row, a set of rows, or even individual elements.
2. Create the necessary number of threads and assign them the chunks of matrices `A` and `B` to be multiplied.
3. In each thread, perform the necessary multiplication and addition to compute the portion of the result matrix `C`.
4. Collect the results from the threads and assemble the final matrix `C`.

You can start with the following code snippet for reading two matrices from the user and defining the multiplication function:

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 4; // Define the size of the matrix
    let a: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![
        vec![1, 2, 3, 4],
        vec![5, 6, 7, 8],
        vec![9, 10, 11, 12],
        vec![13, 14, 15, 16],
    ];
    let b: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![
        vec![17, 18, 19, 20],
        vec![21, 22, 23, 24],
        vec![25, 26, 27, 28],
        vec![29, 30, 31, 32],
    ];

    let c = parallel_matrix_multiplication(&a, &b, n);
    println!("Result: {:?}", c);
}

fn parallel_matrix_multiplication(a: &Vec<Vec<i32>>, b: &Vec<Vec<i32>>, n: usize) -> Vec<Vec<i32>> {
    // TODO: Implement parallel multiplication
    vec![vec![0; n]; n] // Placeholder
}
```
