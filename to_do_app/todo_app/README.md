**Task: Develop a Command-Line To-Do List Application**

**Features**:

1. **Basic CRUD Operations**:
   - Add a new to-do item.
   - List all to-do items.
   - Delete a specific to-do item by ID.
   - Update a to-do item by ID.

2. **Persistence**:
   - Use the `serde` crate for serialization and deserialization.
   - Save the to-do list to a file and read from it upon startup.

3. **Priority Levels**:
   - Allow setting a priority level (High, Medium, Low) for each to-do.
   - Display items with a higher priority first.

4. **Due Dates**:
   - Allow setting a due date for each to-do.
   - Display items due soon at the top.

5. **Interactive Mode**:
   - Allow the user to interactively manage their to-do list without restarting the application.

6. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implement a search functionality to find specific to-dos by their description.

**Steps**:

1. **Setup**:
   - Create a new Rust project using Cargo.

2. **Structs**:
   - Define a `Todo` struct with fields like `id`, `description`, `priority`, `due_date`, etc.

3. **File Operations**:
   - Implement functions for reading and writing the to-do list to a file.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement functions for adding, listing, deleting, and updating to-do items.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Create a user interface in the command-line to allow users to choose operations and input data.

6. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add the priority and due date features.
   - Implement the interactive mode and search functionality.

7. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected.
